# Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Self Care Catalysts understand and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Self Care Catalysts is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Self Care Catalysts has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Self Care Catalysts Customers to support data retention laws.

## State Medical Record Laws

## Data Retention Policy

* Current Self Care Catalysts Customers have data stored by Self Care Catalysts as a part of the Self Care Catalysts Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are 
	1. Customer is sent a notice of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account as 
	2. If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Self Care Catalysts and/or to have Self Care Catalysts continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Self Care Catalysts will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
	3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Self Care Catalysts within 30 days, Self Care Catalysts removed data from Self Care Catalysts systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
